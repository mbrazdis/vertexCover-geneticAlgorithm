Vertex Cover Genetic Algorithm

This project implements a genetic algorithm to find an approximate solution to the minimum vertex cover problem for a given graph. The genetic algorithm iteratively evolves a population of potential solutions, aiming to minimize the size of the vertex cover while ensuring that all edges in the graph are covered.

Features

Graph Representation: Load graphs from files and represent them using an adjacency list.

Genetic Algorithm Components: Initialization, selection, crossover, mutation, and fitness evaluation.

Fitness Function: Combines the size of the vertex cover and the number of uncovered edges.

Configurable Parameters: Population size, number of generations, crossover rate, and mutation rate.

Detailed Output: Prints the initial population, fitness values, and results after each generation.
